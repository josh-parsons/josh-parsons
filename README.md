# Hey there, I'm Josh! 👋

I'm a full-stack web developer and Ruby on Rails enthusiast with a passion for building scalable, maintainable systems and optimizing developer workflows. 
With expertise in Rails, React, and PostgreSQL, I focus on creating clean, efficient code that drives performance and reliability.

### A little about me:
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Proud dad of two amazing kiddos, who keep me busy when I’m not coding.
- 🏔 I like to ski and mountain bike.
- 💻 I enjoy working in the terminal (currently mastering Vim and tmux) and continually experiment with tools that streamline development processes.
